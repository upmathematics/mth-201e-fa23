<h2><strong>Learning Goals</strong></h2>
<div id="description" class="section level3">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>For this course students will describe relationships between changing
quantities using the tools of differential and integral calculus. The
ideas of continuity, limits, differentiation, and integration are
explored at both a theoretical level and in applied contexts. Students
will further develop problem-solving skills and improve mathematical
communication.</p>
</div>
<div id="core-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Core Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland offers a liberal arts Core Curriculum with
a vision of students acquiring knowledge, skills, and values that will
prepare you to respond to the needs of the world and its human family,
while having a foundation of multiple lenses to address enduring
questions of human concern. The University Core Curriculum strives to
achieve this vision by cultivating six habits of heart and mind in all
graduates regardless of major.</p>
<p>As a priority for this Core class, our focus is the “scientific and
quantitative literacy and problem solving” habit. As part of developing
that habit this course will prioritize students learning to employ
mathematical and statistical skills to explore and make sense of data.
Toward this end, as one specific Core learning outcome for this class,
the expectation is that students who complete this course will be able
to use the tools of differential calculus to solve complex problems and
effectively communicate solutions in written form.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of the semester you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze function defined graphically, numerically, or by
formula.</li>
<li>Describe, evaluate and represent the notions of limit, continuity,
derivative, and antiderivative using multiple representations.</li>
<li>Apply the derivative in optimization problems, linear approximation,
and evaluation of indeterminate forms</li>
<li>Describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, particularly the
connections between are accumulation functions and antiderivatives.</li>
<li>Rely on a cultivated habit of reflective metacognition and
self-assessment.</li>
<li>Write logical progressions of precise mathematical statements that
justify your reasoning and communicate content effectively.</li>

<div id="getting-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting Help</h3>
<p>Don’t hesitate to ask for assistance! I have help hours specifically
in place because I want you to succeed, and the best place to connect
with questions is one-on-one. If you can’t make it to my posted help
hours, let me know and we can find another time. Other help options
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post your question to the class Teams Question-Answering
channel</li>
<li>Get together with classmates to study together</li>
<li>Drop by the Math Resource Center, which offers both drop-in and
appointment-based tutoring.</li>
<li>Use internet search. If you find a resource helpful, let me
know.</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that life happens, and illness, depression, family,
relationships can disrupt our lives. When something arises, please reach
out! I want to be able to support you in this course, and can only do so
if you let me know.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-hours-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Help Hours Guidelines</h3>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or
set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling
behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to
clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive
during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three
recommendations before you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all
concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one
by one.</li>
<li>Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant
materials.</li>
<li>Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you
have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the
strategies you have tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out
of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and
chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for
one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an
appointment.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>I expect you to participate in the class through lectures,
discussion, labs, and other engagements. I also expect you to make use
of opportunities to get help outside of class (help hours, Teams, email,
tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific messages are the most
helpful so I know how I can best help you.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to participate in discussions with their
peers (or each other) regarding homework and other assignments. However,
each student must take responsibility and ownership of their work and
submit their work individually.</p>

<h2><strong>Assignments</strong></h2>
<div id="homework" class="section level3">
<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>You will be required to complete an online homework via WeBWork.
Homework is due Monday, Wednesday, or Friday due 48 hours after it was
posted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is how you can access WeBWork:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are already on WeBWork.</li>
<li>Just log in using your UP credentials at <a
href="https://webwork.up.edu/webwork2/MTH201Quijano-F23/"
target="_blank">WeBWork MTH201Quijano-F23</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Homework is graded automatically. It is strongly suggested that you
do your homework regularly; it’s best done following class, when it is
fresh in your mind. Most questions allow unlimited attempts and there is
no penalty for incorrect answers. If you find yourself stuck on a
problem after many attempts, please reach out for additional help!</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding the contents and how to
log-in to WeBWork, please send me a message though Teams or email.</p>
</div>
<div id="labs" class="section level3">
<h3>Labs</h3>
<p>Labs are assigned semi-weekly will be due on Thursdays at end-of-day.
Lab problems should be either typed or written and submitted as a pdf
file in Teams Assignments. These labs are part of the Core Assessment,
and will have common grading across all MTH 202 sections. Labs will be
graded on three components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Validity:</em> Is the method correct? Is the final solution
correct?</li>
<li><em>Explanation:</em> Is the solution method well explained? Is the
reasonableness of the solution justified?</li>
<li><em>Representation:</em> Is the solution process clearly written? Is
the solution supported with appropriate graphs/diagrams/equations? Is
mathematical notation used clearly and correctly?</li>
</ul>
<p>Labs can be hand-written or typed, but must be uploaded as a single
pdf file. If you had handwritten your answers/solutions on a physical
paper, make sure to label it properly and please scan your document
using a scanner app for convenience. Suggestions: (1) “Tiny Scanner” for
Android or (2) “Scanner App” for iOS.</p>
</div>
<div id="lab-revisions" class="section level3">
<h3>Lab Revisions</h3>
<p>To submit lab revisions, students must complete the following for
each problem you missed:</p>
<ul>
<li>An explanation of the errors you made (A algebra? Graphs? Is there a
specific concept?)</li>
<li>Resolve the problem: be sure to include a clear explanation of your
solution process so that another student in the class will
understand</li>
<li>Identify or create three difficult problems from this unit. (You can
find/modify problems from in-class activities, WeBWork, the textbook,
etc.) Solve each of the problems correctly, clearly describing your
steps.</li>
<li>Create a single PDF that includes (1) the previous lab, (2) the lab
corrections, and (3) the additional practice problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Revised labs can earn up to a score one point higher than the
original score (thus a “Not yet proficient” lab can be revised into a
“Proficient” lab.)</p>
<p>Here are the qualifications for lab revisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must submit labs on time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the rules on lab revisions:</p>

regraded to “NY”.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="quiz-retakes" class="section level3">
<h3>Quiz Retakes</h3>
<p>Much of your work in this class can be revised. Everyone’s path to
understanding is different but we all benefit from reflecting on our
mistakes. Since much of the mathematical content will build on previous
ideas, however, reflecting in a timely way is important (hence a
one-week deadline).</p>
<p>In addition to the regular in-class quizzes, you may retake any of
the Learning Targets that we’ve covered through any either of the
following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>On quiz days there is additional time to retake additional Learning
Target quizzes.</li>
<li>You may schedule a retake on a particular Learning Target in my
office.</li>
<li>The final exam day will be used for additional Learning Target
retakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the qualifications and requirements for a quiz retake:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quiz grade of “NY” or “P”.</li>
<li>The original copy of the previous quiz.</li>
<li>A written corrections of the previous quiz. Your corrections must be
complete. That means you need to rewrite your whole work with the
corrections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the rules on quiz retakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can only retake at most three proficiency quizzes per week.</li>
<li>Quiz retakes by appointment must be scheduled 24 hours in
advance.</li>
<li>For scheduled retakes, you must inform me if you need to retake a
particular learning target.</li>
<li>Quiz retakes must be completed within two weeks of the quiz being
returned to you otherwise the quiz grade is set.</li>
<li>A no-show on a scheduled quiz retake disqualifies you to do retakes
for two weeks except for extenuating circumstances.</li>
<li>All quiz retake qualifications and requirements must be available by
the time of retake otherwise you will need to reschedule.</li>
<li>Doing quiz corrections during a retake is not permitted.</li>
<li>You can retake a proficiency quiz multiple times when
available.</li>

<h3>Final Exam</h3>
<p>The final exam includes (a) a written reflection of the big
mathematical ideas of the course and (b) proficiency quiz retakes. This
exam will be cumulative: it will focus on connections between ideas,
conceptual understanding of the material, and applications rather than
nitty-gritty computations. The final exam time will allow for
proficiency quiz retakes of past learning objectives.</p>

<h2><strong>Expectations</strong></h2>
<div id="attendance-and-participation" class="section level3">
<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>You are expected to actively participate in this classroom community.
Participation includes coming to class on time, being prepared, being
willing to ask questions and share ideas, setting up study groups
outside of class, attending tutoring sessions, posting helpful resources
online, and contributing to the Teams discussion channels. Group and
individual presentations of ideas is a suggested component of
participation. We will cover new course material on Monday, Wednesday,
and Thursday. Most Thursday class times will be for small group work on
labs. Fridays will be mostly for proficiency assessment.</p>
</div>
<div id="late-assignments-and-incompletes" class="section level3">
<h3>Late Assignments and Incompletes</h3>
<p>You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time.
Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time - such
as a medical reason - are understandable. Please let the instructor know
if you are unable to submit your work and have missed the deadline way
beyond its original posted date. Because every assignment is an
important aspect of your learning in this class, we will discuss when
you will turn in the assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable
consequence for your turning it in late. I am committed to successfully
helping you learn from this course.</p>

encouraged to express your point of view, but do so respectfully, and
support your claims with textual evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone has the right to be heard. Maintain confidentiality if a
person decides to share a personal experience.</p></li>
<li><p>No name calling and respect each person’s identity.</p></li>
<li><p>One person speaks at a time. Give chances for other people to
speak.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain the highest standards of excellence for both you and
others.</p></li>
<li><p>Possess the humility to understand that you are not an expert in
everything and that everyone has room for improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>Realize that each person will start with a distinct set of
skills.</p></li>

to have a moment to yourself - or go the bathroom - feel free to do
so.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="inclusion-and-diversity" class="section level3">
<h3>Inclusion and Diversity</h3>
<p>The natural and mathematical sciences are often viewed as objective
disciplines. Science is a method for us to understand how the world
works. However, it is historically built from a small set of privileged
populations that often ignores the biases. I acknowledge that there may
be some parts in this course that have overt and covert biases. Science
is a human endeavor, and the pursuit of knowledge and skill must
incorporate a diverse set of experiences.</p>
<p>I value all students regardless of their background, country of
origin, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability
status, etc. I am are committed to providing a climate of excellence and
inclusiveness within all aspects of this course. If you have any
concerns, issues, or challenges, you are encouraged to discuss with the
instructor (set up a meeting by email or a direct message in Teams) with
the assurance of full confidentiality except for academic integrity code
violations or sexual harassment (which I am obligated by law to
report).</p>
<p>In our classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected,
appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. I support the use
of mathematics as an analytic tool to challenge power, privilege, and
oppression. It is our collective responsibility to create a welcoming
space where ideas can be challenged while individuals are respected. I
ask you to support one another as you develop as mathematicians and
analytic thinkers.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland strives to make its courses and services
fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss
with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to
meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a
disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for
Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic
Resource Center (503-943-8985). If you have an AES Accommodation Plan,
you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to implement your
plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for exams and/or
extended exam time should, where possible, be made two weeks in advance
of an exam, and must be made at least one week in advance of an exam.
Also, if applicable, you should meet with your instructor to discuss
emergency medical information or how best to ensure your safe evacuation
from the building in case of fire or other emergency. All information
that students provide regarding disability or accommodation is
confidential. All students are responsible for completing the required
coursework and are held to the same evaluation standards specified in
the course syllabus.</p>
</div>
<div id="referencing-and-citation-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Referencing and Citation Guidelines</h3>
<p>In your written work for this course, you must cite all sources of
information that you use, whether they are direct quotes, paraphrases,
or summaries. The style of citation that you use should be consistent
throughout your paper. The citation styles for this course are APA and
CSE.</p>
<ul>
<li>APA style is used in the social sciences and psychology. It is
characterized by parenthetical citations that include the author’s last
name and the year of publication. For example, “According to Smith
(2023), the average height of a man in the United States is 5’10”.”</li>
<li>CSE style is used in the natural sciences and engineering. It is
characterized by numbered citations that are listed at the end of the
paper. For example, “[1] Smith, J. (2023). The average height of a man
in the United States. Journal of Human Biology, 55(2), 123-132.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure which citation style to use, please consult with
your instructor. You can also find more information about APA and CSE
style in the Clark Library citation guidelines: <a
href="https://libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">libguides.up.edu/cite</a></p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for citing sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always cite the original source, even if you are quoting from a
secondary source.</li>
<li>Be sure to include all relevant information in your citations, such
as the author’s name, the year of publication, and the title of the
source.</li>
<li>List your references in alphabetical order at the end of your
paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s work without giving
them credit. It is a serious academic offense that can result in a
failing grade or even expulsion from school. By following these
guidelines, you can help to avoid plagiarism and ensure that your work
is properly cited.</p>
</div>
<div id="code-of-academic-integrity" class="section level3">
<h3>Code of Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a diverse academic community of
learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and
engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such
pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present
truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that
they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s
assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without
proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.</p>
<p>Especially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical
responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or
other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit
assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are
original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines
for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the
specific guidelines for their discipline.</p>
<p>The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT without
attribution also constitutes plagiarism. Students must cite any
AI-generated text and ideas and disclose any activities
(e.g. brainstorming, editing, translating, etc.) for which AI was
employed. Students are expected to demonstrate sound judgment in
discerning when and how to utilize AI ethically across their academic
work, upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity. The
misuse of AI to shortcut academic requirements will be considered a
breach of academic integrity. Students who have questions about when and
how to use AI should talk with their instructor.</p>
</div>
<div id="mental-health-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Mental Health Statement</h3>
<p>Anyone may sometimes experience problems with their mental health
that interfere with academic experiences and negatively impact daily
life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health challenges at
UP, please contact the University of Portland Wellness Center in the
lower level of Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and near
Mehling Hall) at 503-943-7134 or <a href="mailto:wellness@up.edu"
class="email">wellness@up.edu</a>. Their services are free and
confidential. In addition, confidential phone counseling is available at
the Pilot Helpline by calling 503-943-7134 and pressing 3. The
University of Portland Campus Safety Department (503-943-4444) also has
personnel trained to respond sensitively to mental health emergencies at
all hours. Remember that getting help is a smart and courageous thing to
do - for yourself, for those you care about, and for those who care
about you.</p>

<h3>Physical Health Statement</h3>
<p>Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions
according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell should
NOT attend class in person. These students should inform their
instructor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Should the instructor need to miss class, the course may be
temporarily conducted remotely. Should the instructor be unable to teach
for an extended period of time, the respective department or unit will
find a substitute to continue the course.</p>
<p>Students who must be in isolation due to COVID-19 symptoms or a
positive test should also contact their instructor as soon as possible
to work out details for keeping up with the course material while in
isolation.</p>
<p>Following current guidance from our county and state health
authorities, face coverings are highly recommended in the classroom and
all indoor spaces. As we move through the semester, however, classroom
rules and procedures may change. All students and instructors must
follow any University-wide COVID-19 rules and procedures that might be
in put place at any given time during the semester for classrooms, labs,
and all common areas of academic buildings. Such rules and procedures
may include required face coverings, suggested distancing protocols and
directions, and limitations on eating and drinking in the classroom,
among other things. Failure to follow any of the COVID-19 classroom
rules in place at the time could result in a student’s removal from the
course and/or a report filed with the Office of Student Conduct.</p>

<h3>Non-Violence Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is committed to fostering a safe and
respectful community free from all forms of violence. Violence of any
kind, and in particular acts of power-based personal violence, are
inconsistent with our mission. Together, all UP community members must
take a stand against violence. Learn more about what interpersonal
violence looks like, campus and community resources, UP’s prevention
strategy, and what we as individuals can do to assist on the Green Dot
website, <a href="www.up.edu/greendot"

<h3>Ethics of Information</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the
investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and
encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the
whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and
honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the
right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information,
including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use,
information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found
in the Clark Library’s guide to the Ethical Use of Information at <a
