%INSTRUCTOR NOTES
%This activity aligns with a Desmos activity for exploring families of functions.

 Name:
 \begin{center}\large{4.6 Related Rates}\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A rectangle has one side of 10cm. The other side is increasing at a rate of 3cm per minute.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item How fast is the area of the rectangle changing at the instant when the growing side is 12cm?	\vspace{10mm}
	\item How fast the diagonal is changing at the instant when the growing side is 12cm?
	\vspace{10mm}
	\end{enumerate}

\item A dose, $D$, of a drug causes a temperature change, $T$, in a patient. For $C$ a positive constant, $$T=\left(\frac{C}{2}-\frac{D}{3}\right)D^{2}$$

Find the rate of change of temperature change with respect to dose.

\item A gas station stands at the intersection of a north-south road and an east-west road. A police car is traveling toward the gas station from the east, chasing a stolen truck that is traveling north away from the gas station. The speed of the police car is 100 mph the moment it is 3 miles from the gas station. At the same time, the truck is 4 miles from the gas station going 80 mph. Is the distance between the car and truck increasing or decreasing? How fast?

\item A searchlight is positioned 10 meters from a sidewalk. A person is walking along the sidewalk at a constant speed of 2 meters per second. The searchlight rotates so that it shines on the person. Find the rate at which the searchlight rotates when the person is 25 meters from the searchlight.
\vfill 
\item A conical tank is being filled with water. The tank has height 4 ft and radius 3 ft. If water is being pumped in at a constant rate of 2 cubic inches per minute, find the rate at which the height of the cone changes when the height is 26 inches. Note the difference in units.
\vfill
\item A person 5 feet tall is walking toward an 18 foot pole. A light is positioned at the top of the pole. Find the rate at which the length of the person’s shadow is changing when the person is 30 feet from the pole and walking at a constant speed of 6 feet per second.

\item Imagine a spherical balloon filling with air. 
	\begin{enumerate}

	\item How fast does the volume of the balloon change with respect to time?
	\vfill
	\item If the radius is increasing at a constant rate of 0.03 inches per minute, how fast is the volume of the balloon changing at the time when its radius is 5 inches?

\item The length of a rectangle increases by 3 feet per minute while the width decreases by 2 feet per minute. When the length is 15 feet and the width is 40 feet, what is the rate at which the following changes:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item area

\item \textbf{Potential Energy} \\For positive $a$, $b$, the potential energy, $U$, of a particle moving along the $x$-axis is $\displaystyle U(x)=b\left(\frac{a^2}{x^2}-\frac{a}{x}\right)+b$, where for $x>0$.

\item \textbf{The Quadratic Family} Consider the function $\displaystyle f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$ where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are parameters.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item How does changing $a$ impact the shape of the graph?
	\item How does changing $h$ and $k$ impact the shape of the graph?
	\item Use calculus to find the critical points of $f$. (Treat $a$, $h$, and $k$ as constants. Your solution may depend on at least one of $a$, $h$, or $k$.) Is the critical point a max or a min? 
	\item Use calculus to find the inflection points of $f$. (Treat $a$, $h$, and $k$ as constants. Your solution may depend on at least one of $a$, $h$, or $k$.) Explain your results.
