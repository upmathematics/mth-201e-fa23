%INSTRUCTOR NOTES
%This activity aligns with a Desmos activity for exploring families of functions.

 \begin{center}\large{4.3 Optimization Part 2}\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item A manufacturer needs to make a cylindrical can that will hold 1.5 liters of liquid. Determine the dimensions of the can that will minimize the amount of material used in its construction. Note that $1$ Liter = $1000$ cm$^3$ and so we can convert $1.5$ liters into $1500$ cm$^3$.  The volume of a cylinder is $V = \pi r^2 h$ and surface area of cylinder is $A = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2$ (see digaram below).

\item On the same side of a straight river are two towns, and both towns want to build a pumping station S. Where should the pumping station be located to minimize the TOTAL length of pipe used to connect each town to the pumping station?

\item A rectangle as one vertex on the origin and the other on the curve $y=e^{-2x}$. Estimate the maximum area of the rectangle.

\item The product of two nonnegative numbers is 144. What is the minimum value of their sum?
